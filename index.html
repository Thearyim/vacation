          The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.

           Considered by many to be a rite of passage for any American, a visit to Yellowstone will leave you in awe of nature's power. Marvel at the kaleidoscopic waters of the Grand Prismatic Spring, catch the hourly show put on by Old Faithful, hike along the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone or simply relax with a picnic at Yellowstone Lake.

          When you visit the Eternal City, prepare to cross a few must-see attractions – the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, to name a few – off your bucket list. Additional treasures like St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel can be found in nearby Vatican City. Escape the tourist crowds with a twilight stroll through the cobblestone streets of Trastevere.
